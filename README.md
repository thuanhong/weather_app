# Weather App


## Mission
You have to develop a React Native app that will work in both iOS and Android platforms. For convenience we are only going to test the app in iOS iphone simulator. Your app will query a local json file and call a third party API to fetch the data and display in the app.


## Open Weather Map API
We are going to be using a third party API to get the required data. It requires you to create an account in them and subscribe you to their api.
